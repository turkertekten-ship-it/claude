scikit-learn is a Python module for machine learning built on top of
SciPy and is distributed under the 3-Clause BSD license.

The project was started in 2007 by David Cournapeau as a Google Summer
of Code project, and since then many volunteers have contributed. See
the About us page
for a list of core contributors.

It is currently maintained by a team of volunteers.

## Installation

### Dependencies

scikit-learn requires:

- Python (>= 3.11)
- NumPy (>= 1.24.1)
- SciPy (>= 1.10.0)
- Narwhals (>= 2.0.1)
- joblib (>= 1.4.0)
- threadpoolctl (>= 3.5.0)

---

Scikit-learn plotting capabilities (i.e., functions start with plot_ and
classes end with Display) require Matplotlib (>= 3.6.1).
For running the examples Matplotlib >= 3.6.1 is required.
A few examples require scikit-image >= 0.22.0, a few examples
require pandas >= 1.5.0, some examples require seaborn >=
0.13.0 and Plotly >= 5.22.0.

### User installation

If you already have a working installation of NumPy and SciPy,
the easiest way to install scikit-learn is using pip:

```
pip install -U scikit-learn
```

or conda:

```
conda install -c conda-forge scikit-learn
```

The documentation includes more detailed installation instructions.
