# Log formatting with colors!

Add colours to the output of Python's logging module.

- Source on GitHub
- Package on PyPI

## Status

colorlog currently requires Python 3.6 or higher. Older versions (below 5.x.x)
support Python 2.6 and above.

- colorlog 6.x requires Python 3.6 or higher.
- colorlog 5.x is an interim version that will warn Python 2 users to downgrade.
- colorlog 4.x is the final version supporting Python 2.

colorama is included as a dependency on Windows, where it is automatically
initialised to support colored output.

This library is over a decade old and supported a wide set of Python versions
for most of its life, which has made it a difficult library to add new features
to. colorlog 6 may break backwards compatibility so that newer features
can be added more easily, but may still not accept all changes or feature
requests. colorlog 4 might accept essential bugfixes but should not be
considered actively maintained and will not accept any major changes or new
features.

## Installation

Install from PyPI with:

```
pip install colorlog
```

Several Linux distributions provide official packages (Debian, Arch,
Fedora, Gentoo, OpenSuse and Ubuntu), and others have user provided
packages (BSD ports, Conda).

## Usage

```
import colorlog

handler = colorlog.StreamHandler()
handler.setFormatter(colorlog.ColoredFormatter())

logger = colorlog.getLogger('example')
logger.addHandler(handler)
```

### Arguments

ColoredFormatter extends logging.Formatter and accepts the
following arguments:

- fmt (default=None): A format string used to output the message. If
None, a default format string is selected based on style (e.g.
%(log_color)s%(levelname)s:%(name)s:%(message)s for % style).
- datefmt, style, validate, defaults: see
logging.Formatter.
- reset (default=True): Implicitly adds a color reset code to the
message output, unless the output already ends with one.
- log_colors (default=None): A mapping of record level names to color
names. If None, colorlog.default_log_colors is used.
- secondary_log_colors (default=None): A mapping of names to log_colors
style mappings, defining additional colors that can be used in format strings.
If None, an empty mapping is used.
- stream (default=None): The stream being written to (e.g. sys.stderr).
Used to detect whether the output is a TTY. Colors are disabled automatically
on non-TTY streams unless force_color is set.
- no_color (default=False): Disable color output. Can also be set via the
NO_COLOR environment variable.
- force_color (default=False): Force color output even on non-TTY streams.
Takes precedence over no_color. Can also be set via the FORCE_COLOR
environment variable.

### Color escape codes

Color escape codes can be selected based on the log records level, by adding
parameters to the format string:

- log_color: Return the color associated with the records level.
- <name>_log_color: Return another color based on the records level if the
formatter has secondary colors configured (see secondary_log_colors below).

Multiple escape codes can be used at once by joining them with commas when
configuring the color for a log level (but can't be used directly in the format
string). For example, black,bg_white would use the escape codes for black
text on a white background.

The following escape codes are made available for use in the format string:

- {color}, fg_{color}, bg_{color}: Foreground and background colors.
- bold, bold_{color}, fg_bold_{color}, bg_bold_{color}: Bold/bright
colors.
- thin, thin_{color}, fg_thin_{color}: Thin colors (terminal dependent).
- reset: Clear all formatting (both foreground and background colors).

The available color names are:

- black
- red
- green
- yellow
- blue
- purple
- cyan
- white

You can also use "bright" colors. These aren't standard ANSI codes, and
support for these varies wildly across different terminals.

- light_black
- light_red
- light_green
- light_yellow
- light_blue
- light_purple
- light_cyan
- light_white

In addition to pre-defined color names, you can use integers from 0 to 255 for
256-color support (e.g. fg_196, bg_42).

## Examples

[image: Example output]

The following snippet creates a ColoredFormatter for use in a logging setup,
with a custom format string and log colors:

```
from colorlog import ColoredFormatter

formatter = ColoredFormatter(
	"%(log_color)s%(levelname)-8s%(reset)s %(blue)s%(message)s",
	log_colors={
		"DEBUG": "cyan",
		"INFO": "green",
		"WARNING": "yellow",
		"ERROR": "red",
		"CRITICAL": "red,bg_white",
	}
)
```

See docs/example.py for full example script.

### Using secondary_log_colors

Secondary log colors are a way to have more than one color that is selected
based on the log level. Each key in secondary_log_colors adds an attribute
that can be used in format strings (message becomes message_log_color), and
has a corresponding value that is identical in format to the log_colors
argument.

The following example highlights the level name using the default log colors,
and highlights the message in red for error and critical level log messages.

```
from colorlog import ColoredFormatter

formatter = ColoredFormatter(
	"%(log_color)s%(levelname)-8s%(reset)s %(message_log_color)s%(message)s",
	secondary_log_colors={
		'message': {
			'ERROR': 'red',
			'CRITICAL': 'red'
		}
	}
)
```

### With dictConfig

```
logging.config.dictConfig({
	'formatters': {
		'colored': {
			'()': 'colorlog.ColoredFormatter',
			'format': "%(log_color)s%(levelname)-8s%(reset)s %(blue)s%(message)s"
		}
	}
})
```

A full example dictionary can be found in tests/test_colorlog.py.

### With fileConfig

```
...

[formatters]
keys=color

[formatter_color]
class=colorlog.ColoredFormatter
format=%(log_color)s%(levelname)-8s%(reset)s %(bg_blue)s[%(name)s]%(reset)s %(message)s from fileConfig
datefmt=%m-%d %H:%M:%S
```

An instance of ColoredFormatter created with those arguments will then be used
by any handlers that are configured to use the color formatter.

A full example configuration can be found in tests/test_config.ini.

### With custom log levels

ColoredFormatter will work with custom log levels added with
logging.addLevelName:

```
import logging, colorlog
TRACE = 5
logging.addLevelName(TRACE, 'TRACE')
formatter = colorlog.ColoredFormatter(log_colors={'TRACE': 'yellow'})
handler = logging.StreamHandler()
handler.setFormatter(formatter)
logger = logging.getLogger('example')
logger.addHandler(handler)
logger.setLevel('TRACE')
logger.log(TRACE, 'a message using a custom level')
```

## Tests

Tests similar to the above examples are found in tests/test_colorlog.py.

## Status

colorlog is in maintenance mode. I try and ensure bugfixes are published,
but compatibility a wide set of Python versions makes this a difficult
codebase to add features to. Any changes that might break backwards
compatibility for existing users will not be considered.

## Alternatives

There are some more modern libraries for improving Python logging you may
find useful.

- structlog
- jsonlog

## Projects using colorlog

GitHub provides a list of projects that depend on colorlog.

Some early adopters included Errbot, Pythran, and zenlog.
