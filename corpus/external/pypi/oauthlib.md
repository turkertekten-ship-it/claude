OAuth often seems complicated and difficult-to-implement. There are several
prominent libraries for handling OAuth requests, but they all suffer from one or
both of the following:

1. They predate the OAuth 1.0 spec, AKA RFC 5849.
1. They predate the OAuth 2.0 spec, AKA RFC 6749.
1. They assume the usage of a specific HTTP request library.

OAuthLib is a framework which implements the logic of OAuth1 or OAuth2 without
assuming a specific HTTP request object or web framework. Use it to graft OAuth
client support onto your favorite HTTP library, or provide support onto your
favourite web framework. If you’re a maintainer of such a library, write a thin
veneer on top of OAuthLib and get OAuth support for very little effort.

## Documentation

Full documentation is available on Read the Docs. All contributions are very
welcome! The documentation is still quite sparse, please open an issue for what
you’d like to know, or discuss it in our Gitter community, or even better, send a
pull request!

## Interested in making OAuth requests?

Then you might be more interested in using requests which has OAuthLib
powered OAuth support provided by the requests-oauthlib library.

## Which web frameworks are supported?

The following packages provide OAuth support using OAuthLib.

- For Django there is:
- django-oauth-toolkit, which includes Django REST framework support.
- django-allauth, which includes Django REST framework as well as Django Ninja support.
- For Flask there is flask-oauthlib and Flask-Dance.
- For Pyramid there is pyramid-oauthlib.
- For Bottle there is bottle-oauthlib.

If you have written an OAuthLib package that supports your favorite framework,
please open a Pull Request, updating the documentation.

## Using OAuthLib? Please get in touch!

Patching OAuth support onto an http request framework? Creating an OAuth
provider extension for a web framework? Simply using OAuthLib to Get Things Done
or to learn?

No matter which we’d love to hear from you in our Gitter community or if you have
anything in particular you would like to have, change or comment on don’t
hesitate for a second to send a pull request or open an issue. We might be quite
busy and therefore slow to reply but we love feedback!

Chances are you have run into something annoying that you wish there was
documentation for, if you wish to gain eternal fame and glory, and a drink if we
