# Python Fire [image: PyPI]

Python Fire is a library for automatically generating command line interfaces
(CLIs) from absolutely any Python object.

- Python Fire is a simple way to create a CLI in Python.
[1]
- Python Fire is a helpful tool for developing and debugging Python code.
[2]
- Python Fire helps with exploring existing code or turning other people's
code into a CLI. [3]
- Python Fire makes transitioning between Bash and Python easier.
[4]
- Python Fire makes using a Python REPL easier by setting up the REPL with the
modules and variables you'll need already imported and created.
[5]

## Installation

To install Python Fire with pip, run: pip install fire

To install Python Fire with conda, run: conda install fire -c conda-forge

To install Python Fire from source, first clone the repository and then run:
python setup.py install

## Basic Usage

You can call Fire on any Python object:

functions, classes, modules, objects, dictionaries, lists, tuples, etc.
They all work!

Here's an example of calling Fire on a function.

```
import fire

def hello(name="World"):
  return "Hello %s!" % name

if __name__ == '__main__':
  fire.Fire(hello)
```

Then, from the command line, you can run:

```
python hello.py  # Hello World!
python hello.py --name=David  # Hello David!
python hello.py --help  # Shows usage information.
```

Here's an example of calling Fire on a class.

```
import fire

class Calculator(object):
  """A simple calculator class."""

  def double(self, number):
    return 2 * number

if __name__ == '__main__':
  fire.Fire(Calculator)
```

Then, from the command line, you can run:

```
python calculator.py double 10  # 20
python calculator.py double --number=15  # 30
```

To learn how Fire behaves on functions, objects, dicts, lists, etc, and to learn
about Fire's other features, see the Using a Fire CLI page.

For additional examples, see The Python Fire Guide.

## Why is it called Fire?

When you call Fire, it fires off (executes) your command.

## Where can I learn more?

Please see The Python Fire Guide.
