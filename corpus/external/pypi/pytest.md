The pytest framework makes it easy to write small tests, yet
scales to support complex functional testing for applications and libraries.

An example of a simple test:

```
# content of test_sample.py
def inc(x):
    return x + 1

def test_answer():
    assert inc(3) == 5
```

To execute it:

```
$ pytest
============================= test session starts =============================
collected 1 items

test_sample.py F

================================== FAILURES ===================================
_________________________________ test_answer _________________________________

    def test_answer():
>       assert inc(3) == 5
E       assert 4 == 5
E        +  where 4 = inc(3)

test_sample.py:5: AssertionError
========================== 1 failed in 0.04 seconds ===========================
```

Thanks to pytest’s detailed assertion introspection, you can simply use plain assert statements. See getting-started for more examples.

## Features

- Detailed info on failing assert statements (no need to remember self.assert* names)
- Auto-discovery
of test modules and functions
- Modular fixtures for
managing small or parametrized long-lived test resources
- Can run unittest (or trial)
test suites out of the box
- Python 3.10+ or PyPy3
- Rich plugin architecture, with over 1300+ external plugins and thriving community
