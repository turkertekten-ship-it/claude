HTTPX - A next-generation HTTP client for Python.

[image: Test Suite] [image: Package version]

HTTPX is a fully featured HTTP client library for Python 3. It includes an integrated command line client, has support for both HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2, and provides both sync and async APIs.

---

Install HTTPX using pip:

```
$ pip install httpx
```

Now, let's get started:

```
>>> import httpx
>>> r = httpx.get('https://www.example.org/')
>>> r
<Response [200 OK]>
>>> r.status_code
200
>>> r.headers['content-type']
'text/html; charset=UTF-8'
>>> r.text
'<!doctype html>\n<html>\n<head>\n<title>Example Domain</title>...'
```

Or, using the command-line client.

```
$ pip install 'httpx[cli]'  # The command line client is an optional dependency.
```

Which now allows us to use HTTPX directly from the command-line...

## Dependencies

The HTTPX project relies on these excellent libraries:

- httpcore - The underlying transport implementation for httpx.

 - h11 - HTTP/1.1 support.
- certifi - SSL certificates.
- idna - Internationalized domain name support.
- sniffio - Async library autodetection.

As well as these optional installs:

- h2 - HTTP/2 support. (Optional, with httpx[http2])
- socksio - SOCKS proxy support. (Optional, with httpx[socks])
- rich - Rich terminal support. (Optional, with httpx[cli])
- click - Command line client support. (Optional, with httpx[cli])
- brotli or brotlicffi - Decoding for "brotli" compressed responses. (Optional, with httpx[brotli])
- zstandard - Decoding for "zstd" compressed responses. (Optional, with httpx[zstd])

A huge amount of credit is due to requests for the API layout that
much of this work follows, as well as to urllib3 for plenty of design
inspiration around the lower-level networking details.
