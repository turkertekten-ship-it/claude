SQLModel is a library for interacting with SQL databases from Python code, with Python objects. It is designed to be intuitive, easy to use, highly compatible, and robust.

SQLModel is based on Python type annotations, and powered by Pydantic and SQLAlchemy.

The key features are:

- Intuitive to write: Great editor support. Completion everywhere. Less time debugging. Designed to be easy to use and learn. Less time reading docs.
- Easy to use: It has sensible defaults and does a lot of work underneath to simplify the code you write.
- Compatible: It is designed to be compatible with FastAPI, Pydantic, and SQLAlchemy.
- Extensible: You have all the power of SQLAlchemy and Pydantic underneath.
- Short: Minimize code duplication. A single type annotation does a lot of work. No need to duplicate models in SQLAlchemy and Pydantic.

## SQL Databases in FastAPI

SQLModel is designed to simplify interacting with SQL databases in FastAPI applications, it was created by the same author. 😁

It combines SQLAlchemy and Pydantic and tries to simplify the code you write as much as possible, allowing you to reduce the code duplication to a minimum, but while getting the best developer experience possible.

SQLModel is, in fact, a thin layer on top of Pydantic and SQLAlchemy, carefully designed to be compatible with both.

## Requirements

A recent and currently supported version of Python.

As SQLModel is based on Pydantic and SQLAlchemy, it requires them. They will be automatically installed when you install SQLModel.

## Installation

Make sure you create a virtual environment, activate it, and then install SQLModel, for example with:

```
$ pip install sqlmodel
---> 100%
Successfully installed sqlmodel
```

## Example

For an introduction to databases, SQL, and everything else, see the SQLModel documentation.

Here's a quick example. ✨

### A SQL Table

Imagine you have a SQL table called hero with:

- id
- name
- secret_name
- age

And you want it to have this data:

| id | name | secret_name | age |
| 1 | Deadpond | Dive Wilson | null |
| 2 | Spider-Boy | Pedro Parqueador | null |
| 3 | Rusty-Man | Tommy Sharp | 48 |

### Create a SQLModel Model

Then you could create a SQLModel model like this:

```
from sqlmodel import Field, SQLModel

class Hero(SQLModel, table=True):
    id: int | None = Field(default=None, primary_key=True)
    name: str
    secret_name: str
    age: int | None = None
```

That class Hero is a SQLModel model, the equivalent of a SQL table in Python code.

And each of those class attributes is equivalent to each table column.

### Create Rows

Then you could create each row of the table as an instance of the model:

```
hero_1 = Hero(name="Deadpond", secret_name="Dive Wilson")
hero_2 = Hero(name="Spider-Boy", secret_name="Pedro Parqueador")
hero_3 = Hero(name="Rusty-Man", secret_name="Tommy Sharp", age=48)
```

This way, you can use conventional Python code with classes and instances that represent tables and rows, and that way communicate with the SQL database.

### Editor Support

Everything is designed for you to get the best developer experience possible, with the best editor support.

Including autocompletion:

And inline errors:

### Write to the Database

You can learn a lot more about SQLModel by quickly following the tutorial, but if you need a taste right now of how to put all that together and save to the database, you can do this:

```
from sqlmodel import Field, Session, SQLModel, create_engine

class Hero(SQLModel, table=True):
    id: int | None = Field(default=None, primary_key=True)
    name: str
    secret_name: str
    age: int | None = None

hero_1 = Hero(name="Deadpond", secret_name="Dive Wilson")
hero_2 = Hero(name="Spider-Boy", secret_name="Pedro Parqueador")
hero_3 = Hero(name="Rusty-Man", secret_name="Tommy Sharp", age=48)

engine = create_engine("sqlite:///database.db")

SQLModel.metadata.create_all(engine)

with Session(engine) as session:
    session.add(hero_1)
    session.add(hero_2)
    session.add(hero_3)
    session.commit()
```

That will save a SQLite database with the 3 heroes.

### Select from the Database

Then you could write queries to select from that same database, for example with:

```
from sqlmodel import Field, Session, SQLModel, create_engine, select

class Hero(SQLModel, table=True):
    id: int | None = Field(default=None, primary_key=True)
    name: str
    secret_name: str
    age: int | None = None

engine = create_engine("sqlite:///database.db")

with Session(engine) as session:
    statement = select(Hero).where(Hero.name == "Spider-Boy")
    hero = session.exec(statement).first()
    print(hero)
```

### Editor Support Everywhere

SQLModel was carefully designed to give you the best developer experience and editor support, even after selecting data from the database:

## SQLAlchemy and Pydantic

That class Hero is a SQLModel model.

But at the same time, ✨ it is a SQLAlchemy model ✨. So, you can combine it and use it with other SQLAlchemy models, or you could easily migrate applications with SQLAlchemy to SQLModel.

And at the same time, ✨ it is also a Pydantic model ✨. You can use inheritance with it to define all your data models while avoiding code duplication. That makes it very easy to use with FastAPI.
