# TOML Kit - Style-preserving TOML library for Python

TOML Kit is a 1.1.0-compliant TOML library.

It includes a parser that preserves all comments, indentations, whitespace and internal element ordering,
and makes them accessible and editable via an intuitive API.

You can also create new TOML documents from scratch using the provided helpers.

Part of the implementation has been adapted, improved and fixed from Molten.

## Usage

See the documentation for more information.

## Limitations

tomlkit preserves the original layout of a document, with one exception: a
sub-table that extends an array of tables out of order — for example a
[fruit.apple.texture] header that appears after [[fruit]] with an unrelated
table in between — is normalized into the array's last element when the document
is re-serialized, rather than kept at its original position. The data is
preserved; only the physical placement of that sub-table changes.

## Installation

If you are using uv, you can
add tomlkit to your pyproject.toml file by using:

```
uv add tomlkit
```

Or just:

```
uv pip install tomlkit
```

If not, you can use pip:

```
pip install tomlkit
```

## Running tests

Please clone the repo with submodules with the following command:

```
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/python-poetry/tomlkit.git
```

The toml-test submodule is required for running the tests.

You can then run the tests with

```
poetry run pytest -q tests
```
