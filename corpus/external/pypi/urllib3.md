urllib3 is a powerful, user-friendly HTTP client for Python.
urllib3 brings many critical features that are missing from the Python
standard libraries:

- Thread safety.
- Connection pooling.
- Client-side SSL/TLS verification.
- File uploads with multipart encoding.
- Helpers for retrying requests and dealing with HTTP redirects.
- Support for gzip, deflate, brotli, and zstd encoding.
- Proxy support for HTTP and SOCKS.
- 100% test coverage.

... and many more features, but most importantly: Our maintainers have a 15+
year track record of maintaining urllib3 with the highest code standards and
attention to security and safety.

Much of the Python ecosystem already uses urllib3
and you should too.

## Installing

urllib3 can be installed with pip:

```
$ python -m pip install urllib3
```

Alternatively, you can grab the latest source code from GitHub:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/urllib3/urllib3.git
$ cd urllib3
$ pip install .
```

## Getting Started

urllib3 is easy to use:

```
>>> import urllib3
>>> resp = urllib3.request("GET", "http://httpbin.org/robots.txt")

>>> resp.data
b"User-agent: *\nDisallow: /deny\n"
```
