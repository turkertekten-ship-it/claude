  Audit an existing RAG implementation for anti-patterns and best-practice
  violations - chunking strategy, embedding choice, retrieval configuration,
  context assembly, and evaluation coverage. Use when reviewing retrieval code
  before it ships, when retrieval quality is poor and the cause is not yet
  known, or when adding a stage to an existing pipeline. Reports findings
  against the code that is actually present; it does not rewrite it.

# RAG Audit Skill

Analyze RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) implementations for anti-patterns, performance issues, and best practices violations.

## When to Use

Use `/rag-audit` when:
- Reviewing existing RAG code for quality issues
- Before deploying a RAG system to production
- Debugging retrieval or generation problems
- Optimizing RAG pipeline performance

## What This Skill Does

1. **Code Analysis**: Scans your codebase for RAG-related code (embeddings, vector stores, retrieval, generation)
2. **Anti-Pattern Detection**: Identifies common mistakes and suboptimal patterns
3. **Best Practices Check**: Validates against industry standards
4. **Recommendations**: Provides actionable fixes with code examples

## Audit Categories

### 1. Chunking Strategy
- [ ] Chunk size appropriateness (too large loses precision, too small loses context)
- [ ] Overlap configuration (recommended: 10-20% of chunk size)
- [ ] Document-type specific chunking (code vs prose vs tables)
- [ ] Metadata preservation during chunking

### 2. Embedding Configuration
- [ ] Model selection for use case (multilingual, code, general)
- [ ] Dimension efficiency (smaller dims for speed, larger for accuracy)
- [ ] Batch processing for large document sets
- [ ] Embedding caching to avoid recomputation

### 3. Vector Store Setup
- [ ] Index type selection (HNSW vs IVF vs flat)
- [ ] Distance metric matching (cosine for normalized, L2 for raw)
- [ ] Collection/namespace organization
- [ ] Metadata filtering capabilities

### 4. Retrieval Pipeline
- [ ] Top-k selection (too few misses context, too many adds noise)
- [ ] Score thresholding implementation
- [ ] Hybrid search (dense + sparse/BM25)
- [ ] Reranking stage presence
- [ ] Query expansion/transformation

### 5. Generation Configuration
- [ ] Context window utilization
- [ ] System prompt quality
- [ ] Source citation implementation
- [ ] Hallucination guardrails
- [ ] Temperature settings for factual tasks

### 6. Production Readiness
- [ ] Error handling and fallbacks
- [ ] Logging and observability
- [ ] Rate limiting and caching
- [ ] Cost optimization (model selection, caching)

## How to Run an Audit

When the user invokes `/rag-audit`, follow this process:

### Step 1: Discover RAG Code
Search for RAG-related patterns in the codebase:

```
Patterns to search:
- "embedding" OR "embeddings" OR "embed("
- "vector" OR "vectorstore" OR "vector_store"
- "qdrant" OR "pinecone" OR "chroma" OR "weaviate" OR "milvus"
- "chunk" OR "chunking" OR "split" OR "splitter"
- "retriev" OR "search" OR "query"
- "langchain" OR "llamaindex" OR "haystack"
- "openai.embed" OR "cohere.embed" OR "voyageai"
```

### Step 2: Analyze Each Component
For each RAG component found, check against the audit categories above.

### Step 3: Generate Report
Produce a structured audit report:

```markdown
# RAG Audit Report

## Summary
- **Files Analyzed**: X
- **Issues Found**: Y (X critical, Y warnings, Z suggestions)
- **Overall Score**: X/100

## Critical Issues
[Issues that will cause failures or severe degradation]

## Warnings
[Issues that impact quality or performance]

## Suggestions
[Optimizations and best practices]

## Detailed Findings

### [Component Name]
**Location**: `path/to/file.py:line`
**Issue**: [Description]
**Impact**: [What goes wrong]
**Fix**: [How to fix with code example]
```

## Common Anti-Patterns to Flag

### 1. No Chunk Overlap
```python
# BAD: No overlap causes context loss at boundaries
chunks = text_splitter.split(text, chunk_size=1000, overlap=0)

# GOOD: 10-20% overlap preserves context
chunks = text_splitter.split(text, chunk_size=1000, overlap=150)
```

### 2. Hardcoded Top-K
```python
# BAD: Fixed top-k regardless of query complexity
results = vectorstore.search(query, k=5)

# GOOD: Dynamic or configurable with score threshold
results = vectorstore.search(query, k=10, score_threshold=0.7)
```

### 3. No Reranking
```python
# BAD: Using raw vector similarity scores only
docs = vectorstore.similarity_search(query, k=5)
context = "\n".join([d.content for d in docs])

# GOOD: Rerank for relevance before using
docs = vectorstore.similarity_search(query, k=20)
reranked = reranker.rerank(query, docs, top_k=5)
context = "\n".join([d.content for d in reranked])
```

### 4. Ignoring Metadata
```python
# BAD: Storing only text
vectorstore.add(texts=chunks)

# GOOD: Preserve source metadata for citations
vectorstore.add(
    texts=chunks,
    metadatas=[{"source": doc.name, "page": i, "chunk_id": j} for ...]
)
```

### 5. No Error Handling
```python
# BAD: Unhandled failures
response = llm.generate(prompt)

# GOOD: Graceful degradation
try:
    response = llm.generate(prompt)
except RateLimitError:
    response = fallback_response(query)
except Exception as e:
    logger.error(f"Generation failed: {e}")
    response = "I couldn't process your request. Please try again."
```

### 6. Context Window Overflow
```python
# BAD: Stuffing all retrieved docs without checking
context = "\n".join([doc.content for doc in all_docs])
prompt = f"Context: {context}\nQuestion: {query}"

# GOOD: Respect token limits
max_context_tokens = 3000
context = truncate_to_tokens(docs, max_context_tokens)
```

### 7. Missing Hybrid Search
```python
# BAD: Dense-only search misses keyword matches
results = vectorstore.similarity_search(query)

# GOOD: Combine dense + sparse for better recall
dense_results = vectorstore.similarity_search(query, k=10)
sparse_results = bm25.search(query, k=10)
results = reciprocal_rank_fusion(dense_results, sparse_results)
```

### 8. No Query Preprocessing
```python
# BAD: Raw user query to embedding
embedding = embed(user_query)

# GOOD: Clean and optionally expand query
cleaned_query = preprocess(user_query)
# Optional: query expansion for better recall
expanded_queries = expand_query(cleaned_query)
```

## Vendored copy — local modifications

This skill was vendored into this repository from
`floflo777/claude-rag-skills`. Two changes were made to the upstream file:

1. **YAML front matter was added** (above). Upstream ships this file with no
   front matter, so Claude Code cannot index it and it never triggers on its
   own. The `name` and `description` fields are written here; they are not
   upstream's words.
2. **This note was appended.**

The body between those two additions is upstream's, unedited.

**Read the vendor steer.** Upstream is published by Ailog, which sells a
hosted RAG API. Where this skill recommends a managed service, a specific
framework, or a benchmark against Ailog's own endpoint, treat it as a vendor
preference and not as a finding. The chunking, retrieval and evaluation
reasoning is sound and framework-neutral; the procurement advice is not
neutral. This repository's pipeline is deliberately zero-dependency — see
`README.md` design principle 1 — so a recommendation to adopt LangChain,
LlamaIndex, or a hosted API is a recommendation to abandon a stated design
principle, and needs to be argued on its merits rather than adopted.
