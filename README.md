# claude — fleet substrate

Operating rules, prompts, provenance, and tooling for a fleet of Claude
sessions working on one owner's behalf.

Start with **[CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md)**. Then read
**[provenance/observations.md](provenance/observations.md)** — it is the only
file here that states established fact, and everything else is built on it.

## The one rule

A factual claim is either sourced or it is not written down.

Claims carry a `[src:ID]` tag resolving to `provenance/sources.yaml`. Anything
unsourced belongs in `provenance/unknowns.md` as an open question. This is
enforced, not trusted:

```bash
bash tests/run_all.sh        # verifier + both test suites
```

## What is here

| Path | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `CLAUDE.md` | The doctrine. Read first. |
| `FLEET.md` | Which sessions run concurrently, and on which branches. |
| `provenance/` | The ledger, the observations, the unknowns, the raw captures. |
| `prompts/` | System prompts carrying the doctrine into a session. |
| `tools/verify_provenance.py` | The fabrication guard. |
| `tools/ingest_chat_archive.py` | Conversation-archive ingestion and search. |
| `tests/` | Tests for both tools, including their failure cases. |
| `.claude/commands/` | The workflows, as slash commands. |
| `.claude/agents/` | `observer` and `fact-checker` subagents. |
| `.claude/` | Hooks and the OODA skill. |
| `docs/workflows.md` | How the workflows and subagents fit together. |
| `src/oodarag/` | The RAG pipeline this substrate exists to build. |
| `.claude/skills/` | Installed skills. See [SKILLS.md](SKILLS.md) for routing. |
| `tools/probe_egress.py` | Reproducible map of what this container can actually reach. |

## Searching your conversations

The archive ships empty, because no conversation export existed when this was
built. To populate it:

```bash
# claude.ai: Settings -> Privacy -> Export data, unzip into archive/
# Claude Code: cp ~/.claude/projects/**/*.jsonl archive/

python3 tools/ingest_chat_archive.py ingest
python3 tools/ingest_chat_archive.py search "retrieval pipeline"
python3 tools/ingest_chat_archive.py stats
```

Messages are stored verbatim and every hit carries its conversation id,
message id, timestamp, and source file, so a result can be quoted as evidence.
Records that cannot be parsed are skipped and counted, never repaired by
guesswork. `archive/` is git-ignored — the exports are the owner's data, not
repository content.

## Status

The tooling runs and is tested. The provenance ledger holds what was actually
established on 2026-08-27. The chat index holds nothing yet, and says so
rather than pretending otherwise.
